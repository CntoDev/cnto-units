The CNTO units catalog
======================

Soldier and vehicle definitions and groups belong here - mainly custom unit
"compositions" and loadouts. Note that while ie. custom factions (as units)
should be created here, any custom assets (3D models, artwork, textures, ..)
should be stored in the `cnto-assets` repository instead and only referenced
from here.

Please use 1 addon (directory, to be packed into PBO before use) as 1 faction,
defining loadouts, structures, vehicles, etc. for that faction within the dir.

Put any helper and shared `#define`s and templates into the `shared` addon.
